# simple DoIP parser
A simple Diagnostics over IP (DoIP) parser written in C. It does leverage [hammer](https://github.com/UpstandingHackers/hammer)
to be more reliable. This parser accepts DoIP messages which follow the
general format.
A more powerful parser which validates individual messages is available upon request.
